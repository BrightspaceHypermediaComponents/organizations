## Versioning, Releasing & Deploying

By default, when a pull request is merged the patch version in the `package.json` will be incremented, a tag will be created, and a Github release will be created.

Include `[increment major]`, `[increment minor]` or `[skip version]` in your merge commit message to change the default versioning behavior.
